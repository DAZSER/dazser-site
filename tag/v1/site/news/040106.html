<p> <strong>Jani-King Continues European Expansion</strong> </p>
<p> <strong>April, 2006 (Addison, TX)</strong> &mdash; Jani-King International is proud to announce that   	the rights to Jani-King of Greece were recently purchased as Jani-King continues expansion   	throughout Europe.  Since 1974, Jani-King has continued to develop its international program   	by offering master franchise rights worldwide.  According to Franchise Times magazine,   	Jani-King is the 8th largest global franchisor in terms of number of units. </p>
<p> &ldquo;Jani-King had interest from multiple parties for the rights to sell the number one rated   	commercial cleaning franchise in Greece,&rdquo; stated Gary Dick, Vice President of  Jani-King   	Franchising, Inc.  &ldquo;In the end, a group of investors were selected as the new Jani-King Master   	Franchise Owners.  Let&rsquo;s all welcome Cristos Habachy, Evangelina Korontini, George Dostis   	and Philippos Korovesis to the Jani-King family.&rdquo; </p>
<p> Jani-King of Greece will open the doors to its first regional office in Athens, Greece.    	Athens is the capital of Greece and one of the most famous cities in the world. Modern   	Athens is a bustling, cosmopolitan metropolis; Ancient Athens was a powerful city-state   	and a renowned center of learning. It was named after goddess Athena. </p>
<p> The Athens metropolitan area is home to some 3.7 million people and it is currently   	growing both northwards and eastwards across Attica (Greater Athens). Athens is the   	dominant center of economic, financial, industrial, cultural and political life in   	Greece today. The city is also rapidly becoming a leading business center in Europe. </p>
<p> Ancient Athens is considered to have been the cradle of Western civilization. This is   	largely due to the immense impact of its cultural and political achievements during the   	4th and 5th centuries BC on the rest of the then known world. This heritage is still   	evident in the city, portrayed through a number of spectacular ancient monuments and artworks,   	the most famous of all being the Parthenon on the Acropolis, widely regarded as one of the   	finest examples of Classical Greek architecture. Many of these cultural landmarks were   	renovated ahead of the 2004 Olympic Games. </p>
