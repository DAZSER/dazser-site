    <span style="padding-top:0px;"><span class="style3">T</span>he <strong>DAZSER</strong> Companies were started by David A. Zillig and Stephen E. Roesch (DAZSER comes from their initials).  After graduating from Denison University and spending 8 years in sales, Dave wanted to own his own business.  Steve graduated from the Johns Hopkins University, worked for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and later started a small computer software company.  Feeling that their sales and management skills were a good match, Dave and Steve began investigating franchise opportunities in 1985.  Their search led them to Jani-King and today they operate Regional Offices in Tampa Bay, Baltimore, Birmingham, Charlotte and Orlando, making them one of the largest and most successful Master Franchisors in Jani-King. </span></p>
