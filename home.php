The <acronym>DAZSER</acronym> Companies were started by David A. Zillig and 
Stephen E. Roesch (<acronym>DAZSER</acronym> comes from their initials). After graduating from Denison 
University and spending 8 years in sales, Dave wanted to own his own business. Steve graduated from the 
Johns Hopkins University, worked for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and later started a small 
computer software company. Feeling that their sales and management skills were a good match, Dave and 
Steve began investigating franchise opportunities in 1985. Their search led them to Jani-King and today they 
operate Regional Offices in Tampa Bay, Baltimore, Birmingham, Charlotte and Orlando, making them one of the 
largest and most successful Master Franchisors in Jani-King.</p>
